* unicode_callbacks.c: if there's no BOM, pattern match zeroes:

  From RFC4627:

    Since the first two characters of a JSON text will always be ASCII
    characters [RFC0020], it is possible to determine whether an octet
    stream is UTF-8, UTF-16 (BE or LE), or UTF-32 (BE or LE) by looking
    at the pattern of nulls in the first four octets.

    00 00 00 xx  UTF-32BE
    00 xx 00 xx  UTF-16BE
    xx 00 00 00  UTF-32LE
    xx 00 xx 00  UTF-16LE
    xx xx xx xx  UTF-8

This won't work for an UTF-8 empty object {} or array [] though.

* i18n support for error messages
